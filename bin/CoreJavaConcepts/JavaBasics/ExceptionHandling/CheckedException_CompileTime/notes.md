Checked exceptions are the exceptions that are checked at compile time, meaning the compiler ensures that they are properly handled using try-catch or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword.

Examples of checked exceptions include:

IOException: Thrown when there's an I/O error.
SQLException: Thrown for database access errors.
