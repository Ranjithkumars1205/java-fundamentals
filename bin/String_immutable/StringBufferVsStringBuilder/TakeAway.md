StringBuffer and StringBuilder are both classes in Java that represent mutable sequences of characters. They are used to create and modify strings efficiently when you need mutable (modifiable) string data.

Here are the key differences between StringBuffer and StringBuilder:

Mutability:

StringBuffer is mutable, meaning the contents of a StringBuffer object can be modified after it is created.
StringBuilder is also mutable and offers similar functionality to StringBuffer.
Synchronization:

StringBuffer is synchronized, making it thread-safe, but potentially slower when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.
StringBuilder is not synchronized, offering better performance in a single-threaded environment but is not thread-safe.
Performance:

Due to synchronization, StringBuffer operations might be slower compared to StringBuilder operations in a single-threaded scenario.
In a single-threaded environment, StringBuilder is typically faster due to lack of synchronization overhead.
Usage:

Use StringBuffer when you need a mutable string and thread safety is a concern (e.g., in a multi-threaded application).
Use StringBuilder when you need a mutable string and thread safety is not a concern (e.g., in a single-threaded application or when synchronization is handled at a higher level).
