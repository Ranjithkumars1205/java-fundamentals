Abstract:

both abstract and not abstract method suppored((like default method in inferface) rest all the methods suppored)
default method not supported but we can have final method
there is no restriction for variables.
It can't be instantiated

Interface:
only abstract method
But it can have non-abstract method with default, static and private only. final method is not supported
multiple inheritance supported with non-abstract method.but not with default method which has body
private data member is not allowed
data member must be initialized and can't be modified ( Interface fields are public, static and final by default, and the methods are public and abstract.)
It can't be instantiated
It provides total abstraction;
