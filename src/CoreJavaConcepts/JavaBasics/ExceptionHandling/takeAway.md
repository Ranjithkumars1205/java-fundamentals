Suppose there are 10 statements in a Java program and an exception occurs at statement 5; the rest of the code will not be executed, i.e., statements 6 to 10 will not be executed. However, when we perform exception handling, the rest of the statements will be executed. That is why we use exception handling in Java.

Exception handling in Java is a mechanism that allows you to gracefully handle errors, exceptional conditions, or unexpected situations that may occur during program execution.
It helps in preventing the abrupt(sudden) termination of the program by providing a structured way to handle these exceptional conditions.

The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.

In Java, exceptions are instances of classes that derive from the java.lang.Throwable class. There are two main types of exceptions in Java: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions.
Checked Exceptions:
Checked exceptions are the exceptions that are checked at compile time, meaning the compiler ensures that they are properly handled using try-catch or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword.

If we're not handled the exception, it will terminate the rest of the program.
