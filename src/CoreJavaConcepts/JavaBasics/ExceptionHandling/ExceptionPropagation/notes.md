Exception propagation in Java refers to the process of propagating or passing an exception up the call stack to higher levels of the program where it can be handled or reported. When an exception occurs in a method and is not handled within that method, it is thrown to the calling method. This process continues until the exception is either caught and handled or reaches the top of the call stack.
