To achieve synchronized access to a StringBuilder instance, you can use synchronization blocks or methods to ensure that only one thread can access and modify the StringBuilder at a time. This way, you prevent concurrent modifications and maintain thread safety.


In both approaches, we synchronize access to the StringBuilder instance by either using a synchronized block or a synchronized method. This ensures that only one thread can access and modify the StringBuilder at any given time, providing thread safety in a multi-threaded environment.
