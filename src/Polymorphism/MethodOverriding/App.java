package Polymorphism.MethodOverriding;

/**
 * Method overriding is closely related to inheritance. It allows subclasses to
 * inherit behavior from their superclass
 * while customizing or extending that behavior.
 * 
 * Object-oriented programming that allows a subclass to provide a specific
 * implementation of a method that is already defined in its
 * superclass. When a method is overridden in a subclass, *** it has the same
 * name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass ***.
 * The overridden method in the subclass provides a specialized implementation
 * that is specific to the subclass.
 * 
 * Method overriding is already one in inheritance concept, pls go and check it.
 * 
 * Customizing Frameworks: When you're working with a framework or library that
 * provides a base class with default implementations, you can create subclasses
 * to customize or extend the behavior of those methods.
 * 
 * Implementing Interfaces: In Java, when a class implements an interface, it
 * must override all the methods declared in that interface. This allows you to
 * provide concrete implementations for the interface's methods.
 * 
 * Polymorphic Method Calls: When you want to take advantage of polymorphism and
 * call methods on objects of different subclasses through a common interface or
 * superclass reference.
 * 
 * a static method cannot be overridden. It can be proved by runtime
 * polymorphism, so we will learn it later.
